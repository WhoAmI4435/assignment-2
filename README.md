TASK-1: 
variable 'a' takes input as integer
if 'a' is divisible by 2 then it is even so we used if else statement to check that
and then displayed the result

TASK-2
's' is initial submission variable
we used for loop with range 1 to 51 because we wanted to include then number 50
then we added variable 'i' again and again in 's'
and displayed the result
